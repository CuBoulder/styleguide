                <p>Joel Swanson, ATLAS associate professor, teaches digital art, media theory and the history of design for the Creative Technology and Design (formerly TAM) program, where he served as director of the TAM program from 2007 to 2016. His tenure home is in the Herbst Program for Engineering, Ethics and Society, and he has a courtesy appointment in the Intermedia Arts Writing and Performance PhD Program. Joel's research and teaching interests includes digital art, digital media theory, design and typography.</p>
        
        <p>Joel's artwork is motivated by literary theory and exists as a series of installations, both real and virtual, that explore the nature of language and its embodiment. His artwork has been exhibited nationally and internationally at institutions such as the Broad Museum in Lansing, The Power Plant in Toronto and the North Miami Museum of Contemporary Art. In 2014 Joel had a solo exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver. Most recently he showed work in Personal Structures, an official satellite show of the 57th Venice Biennale, and he is represented by David B. Smith Gallery in Denver.  </p>
        
        <p>Joel received his Master of Fine Arts from the University of California San Diego, where his focus was computing and the arts. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts in digital art from CU Boulder.</p>
